## MergeSort
### Java Implementation

MergeSort is a divide and conquer algorithm.
First, it divides the given array into two halves. MergeSort is recursively called
on the two sub-arrays. 

Then the merge() function is used for merging the two halves. 

Time complexity of MergeSort is O(nLogN) in all three cases, Worst, Average, Best.
