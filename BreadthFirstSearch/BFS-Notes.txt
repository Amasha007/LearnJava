## Breadth First Search

The difference between BFS in a tree and BFS in a graph is that graphs may
contain cycles. To process one node only once, we keep track of visited nodes.

When we start from a node, BFS first explores all the children of that node,
prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

The time complexity of the BFS algorithm is O(|V| + |E|) where V is the number
of vertices and E is the number of edges.
